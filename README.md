# Movie Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project implements a Movie Recommendation System using Python. The system analyzes movie data to provide tailored recommendations based on user preferences and similarity measures. The project leverages popular Python libraries like pandas and numpy for data manipulation and analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the following URL:
[Movies Recommendation Dataset](https://github.com/YBI-Foundation/Dataset/raw/main/Movies%20Recommendation.csv)

### Key Dataset Features:
- **Movie Titles**
- **Genres**
- **Ratings**
- **Other relevant metadata**

## Key Functionalities
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
   - Load the dataset from a CSV file.
   - Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyze dataset features.
   - Summarize key insights with `df.info()` and `df.head()`.

3. **Recommendation Logic**
   - Implement algorithms to recommend movies based on user preferences or similarity metrics.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Validate the recommendation system's performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - pandas
  - numpy

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.7 or higher).
3. Install the required libraries using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook using the command:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Movie_Recommendation.ipynb
   ```
5. Follow the code cells to execute the recommendation system.

## Future Enhancements
- Include additional metadata like user reviews and release dates for better recommendations.
- Implement collaborative filtering techniques.
- Create a user interface for easier interaction.
